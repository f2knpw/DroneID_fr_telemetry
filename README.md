# DroneID_fr_telemetry
drone Identification with telemetry broadcast on ground (radio receiver beacon with ESP32)

This code reuses https://github.com/khancyr/droneID_FR. But instead of broadcasting droneID frames on board the drone, it uses telemetry sent by the drone to the radio and broadcast droneID frames from the ground station.

Project is fully explained on my hackaday's project page : https://hackaday.io/project/192752-variometer-gps-tracker-remoteid-for-rc-glider
